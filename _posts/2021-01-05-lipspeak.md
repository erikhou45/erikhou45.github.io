An easy-to-use mobile application to help people with voice disorders communicate effectively

## Description

LipSpeak is focused on helping people with voice disorders, a condition affecting 7.5 million patients in the US alone. Powered by a novel visual keyword spotting neural network architecture, our smartphone app MVP converts userâ€™s lip movements to synthesized speech and is targeted for people who lost their voice due to illness or surgery but are still capable of articulative lip movements.

We intend to use our MVP to contribute to peer and industry learning about how silent speech voicing technologies can be applied to improve the quality of life for people suffering from voice impairments.
